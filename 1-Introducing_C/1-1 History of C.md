# 1.1 History of C

Developed in early 1970s at Bell Labs.

## Origins

C is a by-produce of the UNIX operating system. After UNIX was written in assembly language in 1969, it was rewritten in C by 1973.

The benefit of UNIX being written in C was ***portablity***. C compilers could be written for other machines and UNIX could run on those machines as well.

## Standardization

C89 was standardized in 1989. The language went under some changes in 1995, and a new standard, C99, was created in 1999.

At first, the unofficial standard was *The C Programming Language*, written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, published in 1978. Also known as K&R.

The K&R book was not completely clear and the C language kept changing, so new compilers began to form incompatible dialects of C. This hurt C's portability strength, and a standard had to be created.

## C-Based Languages

Many languages borrow ideas from C:

- ***C++*** includes all of C, but adds classes and other features to support OOP.
- ***Java*** is based on C++.
- ***C#*** is more recent, derived from C++ and Java.
- ***Perl*** was originally a simpl scripting language, but over time adopted many features of C.

C is still used where memory or processing power is limited, or where the simplicity of C is desired.
